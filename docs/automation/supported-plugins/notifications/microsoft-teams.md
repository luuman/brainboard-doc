3. Message: text to be sent.
4. Webhook URL of your MS Teams channel.
5. Hide pipeline URL: Do not add the button with link to the pipeline in the adaptive card of the message displayed in the Teams channel.

#### Setup instructions

If you want to configure Microsoft Teams to receive notifications from Brainboard pipelines, an _incoming hook_ needs to be set up in the channel of your choice. To do so, follow the steps:

1.  Go to your Teams channel where you want the notification to be posted and open its configuration menu in the top-right corner and click on "Workflows":<br>
